# SLOTH Doc

## ***Intro***

Sloths on the Run is a Stable-NFT (sNFT) project. Essentially, each sNFT represents a Sloth that's done some pretty shady stuff in the Web3 world - rug-pulls, hacking, you name it.

Here's the twist: you can jailbreak any Sloth you want for a certain amount of money, then decide whether to keep him locked up or turn him in for a sweet bounty, which is the price for minting. 

In a crypto market that's going through a rough patch, we wanted to create something that goes against the grain. While other de-fi protocols and NFT projects make wild promises, we're all about changing the game for the better.

## *****************How It works!***************** 

The core idea is very simple. You can mint an sNFT just like how you can mint any other NFT. Let’s say you minted a Sloth for $10,000. Minting means you will ‘jailbreak’ the Sloth from prison.

You can use the Sloth as a present to a friend, as a payment to your colleague, or simply just as a way to show off on Twitter. Don’t ever worry about the price falling. 

Additionally, each Sloth has an encrypted invisible watermark. Anyone with Sloths mobile application can scan the Sloth, and the scanning will return the information about the Sloth. As it works even when printed, it also shows the possibility of the world’s first paper crypto! 

Just like how sloths are the most stable and non-moving animals on the planet, the price of the Sloth sNFT is guaranteed by protocol. If you are feeling guilty or need some cash at the moment, feel free to bring the Sloth sNFT back to the protocol and redeem your $10,000. 

## ***What We Built***

First, we built a web app where users can mint and redeem sNFTs. Also, users can send a Sloth sNFT with some tokens as well within the Web App. Let’s say you owe your friend $12,000. With one transaction you can send a $10,000 Sloth sNFT and $2000 USDT. The web app supports multiple chains, including Fuel Network.

Second, we also built a simple mobile application that can scan the invisible watermarks encoded in the Sloths for verification. It is capable of reading the invisible watermark in Sloth within 2 seconds or so. 

## ***The Future: After ETH Denver***

We will continue building and will launch a protocol. Of course, in crypto, there needs to be a profit model. The protocol will first earn a commission from minting, redeeming, and sending sNFTs. The commission gets distributed back to the holders in a decentralized manner every certain fixed time, such as a week. 

We wanted to fix the problem in conventional De-Fi 2.0 protocols that only early on-boarders make a profit while the ones who come in late lose everything. In our sNFT protocol, the interest an investor receives will depend on how much the total value of his sNFTs holds in the whole protocol pool, not when he comes in. 

In short, if the protocol’s TVL is $10M and you have $1M sNFT, you will be receiving 10% of the shared interest. If there was not a single transaction in the protocol during the week, then no interest for everyone. No complication, no scam. Furthermore, this means that the time entering the protocol has no effect whatsoever on the investor, and in fact, the last man standing will be the one to earn the biggest interest, since there will be massive interest from redemption commission! 

## ***Bounty Hunt*** 

Following a thorough analysis of the diverse bounty offerings at ETH DENVER, we have identified several chains that we believe present the most promising potential for the development and deployment of Sloths on the Run.

### *Best Defi/NFT Project on Mantle* 

Sloths on the Run, as a stable NFT project, can benefit from being built on Mantle in several ways. Firstly, Mantle's EVM compatibility means that Sloths on the Run can easily integrate with existing Ethereum-based applications and enjoy the security and stability of Ethereum. Secondly, Mantle's modular architecture and data availability solution (EigenDA) can enable Sloths on the Run to scale its NFT minting and trading activities in a secure and low-fee environment, with minimal gas fees. Additionally, Mantle's use of MPC and a decentralized sequencer can further enhance the network's security and resilience against potential attacks. 

Lastly, Mantle's economic model incentivizes participants to stake $BIT tokens, which contributes to the network's security and stability, further enhancing Sloths on the Run's confidence in the network's reliability. Overall, Mantle's advanced features, EVM compatibility, and efficient network could provide Sloths on the Run with scalability, security, and potential cost savings, all of which could help the project to thrive and succeed in introducing the concept of stable NFTs to the crypto world. 

### *Build A Fullstack Dapp on Fuel* 

Sloths on the Run supports Fuel Network because of its UTXO-based design that is optimized for maximum scalability. This allows for parallel validation of transactions on consumer-grade hardware and eliminates the state bottleneck, as Fuel's unique fraud proof scheme doesn't require state serialization. Fuel's atomic swap feature also enables fast withdrawals for fungible assets such as ETH and ERC-20 tokens, providing a better user experience than the lengthy finalization delay for other types of withdrawals. Additionally, liquidity providers can offer liquidity for quick withdrawals without systemic risk if they fully validate Fuel blocks before accepting a swap.

Furthermore, Fuel Network doesn't require any special key formats or on-chain account registration, making it easy for users to deposit and withdraw funds from the platform. This is particularly useful for a stable NFT project like Sloths on the Run, as it allows users to quickly and easily manage their assets without having to worry about complex or time-consuming registration processes. Overall, Fuel Network's unique features make it an excellent choice for building a stable NFT project like Sloths on the Run, providing fast and efficient transactions that are critical for a successful and scalable project.

Overall, Fuel Network's permissionless and censorship-resistant nature, combined with its fast and low-cost transaction capabilities, make it an ideal chain for Sloths on the Run.

### *Port over Ethereum dApps to Neon-EVM*

We built Sloths on the Run for Neon-EVM because it offered a unique combination of features that aligned with our goals. The Neon-EVM provides a fast, scalable, and low-cost environment for smart contracts to run on. This was crucial for us as we wanted to ensure that our stable NFT project had fast transaction times and low fees. Additionally, Neon-EVM is compatible with Ethereum smart contracts, which allowed us to easily deploy our existing Ethereum-based smart contracts onto the Neon-EVM chain. 

Furthermore, the Neon-EVM is highly secure, with a strong focus on preventing fraudulent activities. This is important for our stable NFT project, as we need to ensure the integrity of our assets and transactions. The Neon-EVM also supports a wide range of developer tools and infrastructure, making it easy for us to integrate our project with existing tools and services.

### *Best Use of Polygon*

For Sloths on the Run, Polygon means that users can mint and trade NFTs more efficiently and with lower fees, which can help reduce the barriers to entry for users. This can increase the accessibility of the NFT project and help attract a larger user base. Additionally, since Polygon is built on top of Ethereum, Sloths on the Run can benefit from the network effects of Ethereum's established ecosystem, including wallets, exchanges, and other DeFi applications.

Polygon SDK can be beneficial for Sloths on the Run as it provides the flexibility to customize the NFT project to meet specific requirements. Sloths on the Run may want to incorporate specific functionality or features that are not available on other NFT marketplaces. By using the Polygon SDK, Sloths on the Run can create its own custom blockchain that is tailored to its needs. This can provide a unique selling point for the NFT project, which can help differentiate it from other NFT projects and attract more users.
